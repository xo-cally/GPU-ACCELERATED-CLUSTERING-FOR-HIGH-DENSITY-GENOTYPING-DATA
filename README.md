# GPU-ACCELERATED-CLUSTERING-FOR-HIGH-DENSITY-GENOTYPING-DATA
This project builds a GPU-accelerated SNP-genotyping pipeline using synthetic, anonymized IDATs from the Sydney Brenner Institute, accessed securely on the Wits Core Cluster. It extracts fluorescence intensities, applies GPU clustering, and benchmarks vs CPU to show faster, scalable, population-scale genotyping.
